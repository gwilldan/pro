# Contributing

Projexa is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let us know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

## Contribution Guidelines

3. Pull origin `git pull origin main`

4. Create a new branch for your code 

6. Then stage your files `git add .`

7. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message : `git commit -m "your commit message"`.

8. IMPORTANT: To make sure there are no conflicts, run `git pull origin makn`.

9. Push changes to your new branch, run `git push -u origin MME-001/Feat/Dashboard`.

10. Create a pull request to the main.

11. Ensure to describe your pull request.

12. > If you've added code that should be tested, add some test examples.

> _Sample Commit Messages_

- `chore: Updated README file` := `chore` is used because the commit didn't make any changes to the , frontend or test folders in any way.
- `feat: Added plugin info endpoints` := `feat` is used here because the feature was non-existent before the commit.

# API

A separate folder called `api` is created withing the app folder here, to make an **API** Call:

- create a new folder within the `app/api` dir
- within the created folder create a `route.ts` file
- within the `route.ts` file you make either a **GET** or **POST** Request
